Based on historical fraud patterns analyzed using {model_used}, I can provide the following forecast:

**Predicted Fraud Rate for {time_period.title()}:**
- **Average fraud rate**: {fraud_rate_percentage:.2f}%
- **Confidence interval**: Â±{forecast_std*100:.2f}%
- **Model used**: {model_used}

This forecast is based on analyzing {forecast_days} days of historical transaction data and applying time series forecasting techniques. The model has been trained on fraud patterns and trends to predict future behavior.

**Key Points:**
- The forecast shows a predicted fraud rate of approximately {fraud_rate_percentage:.2f}%
- This represents the expected average fraud rate over the {time_period}
- The confidence interval provides a range of likely outcomes
- The model considers seasonal patterns, trends, and historical fraud behavior

Please note that this is a statistical prediction based on historical data and should be used as a guide for risk management planning.

Based on historical fraud patterns and transaction value analysis, I can provide the following forecast for fraud value distribution:

**Predicted Fraud Value Distribution:**
- **Cross-border transactions (high-value proxy)**: {cross_border_share:.1f}% of total fraud value
- **Domestic transactions (low-value proxy)**: {domestic_share:.1f}% of total fraud value

**Forecasted Values:**
- **Total fraud value**: ${total_value:,.2f}
- **Cross-border fraud value**: ${cross_border_value:,.2f}
- **Domestic fraud value**: ${domestic_value:,.2f}

**Methodology:**
This forecast uses transaction amounts as a proxy for cross-border activity, where transactions over $100 are considered cross-border and transactions $100 or below are considered domestic. The analysis is based on {forecast_days} days of historical transaction data and applies ARIMA time series forecasting to predict future fraud value patterns.

**Key Insights:**
- The forecast shows that cross-border transactions account for approximately {cross_border_share:.1f}% of total fraud value
- This suggests that high-value transactions are a significant source of fraud risk
- The distribution provides insights for targeted fraud prevention strategies

Please note that this is a statistical prediction based on historical data and should be used as a guide for risk management planning.
